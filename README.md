FinacialInk or FinancialLink (I did it on purpose, so call it as you want :D) is a Self-Hosted "Wealthy Manager" and its Open Source. I dont know why im creating it but I need one so it will be useful to me and maybe for others.


- This system is being based on the videos of a guy called Nazar Nikolov, and he have a playlist at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXClUJhXoQ8&list=PLHQY5AFuyYYUtJiw8R92rHAYha0sTJT1Z of how you can create your own.

What we have here:
- [ ] Expenses Manager
- [ ] Investments Manager (Including specific operations for crypto, why not?)
